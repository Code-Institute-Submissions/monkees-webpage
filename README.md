<h1>User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - Monkees Webpage</h1>

<h3>What does it do and what need does it fulfil?</h3>
The project is created by using skills I have acquired during the first few months of studying coding to create a mobile-first fully responsive static website for the band The Monkees. The purpose of the website is to allow the fans of The Monkees to listen to their music, watch a video, check out the latest news and concert dates, join other fans on social media and contact the bandâ€™s manager to possibly hire the band to perform at an event.

<h3>Functionality of the project</h3>
The website is fully responsive. The picture of the band is visible on larger screens and hidden on smaller ones. The navigation on website is functional and the Book Us form is input validated. The submitting of the form does not connect to  anything at the moment, but as the scope of the project was only front-end, I did not find it useful to spend my time working on that part.

<h3>Design Process</h3>
I went through a design process following the steps I learned in User Design Experience lesson of the course.

<h3>Technologies used to create the project</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cloud IDE
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>FontAwesome</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>GIT</li>
<li>GITHUB</li>
<li>Google Chrome developer tools</li></ul>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
Website was coded in Cloud 9 IDE and can be found at: <a href="https://ide.c9.io/kaidosoo/monkees-webpage" target="_blank">https://ide.c9.io/kaidosoo/monkees-webpage</a>, a local GIT directory was used for version control using commands:
<ul>
<li>git init</li>
<li>git status</li>
<li>git add . </li></ul>
and then uploaded to GITHUB using commands:
<ul>
<li>git commit -m</li>
<li>git remote add origin https://github.com/KaidoSo/monkees-webpage.git</li>
<li>git push -u origin master</li></ul>
Following uploads were performed by commands:
<ul>
<li>git add .</li>
<li>git commit -m</li>
<li>git push</li>
Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: <a href="https://kaidoso.github.io/monkees-webpage/"  target="_blank">https://kaidoso.github.io/monkees-webpage/</a>

<h3>Testing</h3>
Each page was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, testing its functionality as well as look and feel (in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. All links were tested along with music tracks audio controls and video player. All pages were successfully tested in google chrome, internet explorer and my own phone Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact.

<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
The website's Book Us page was giving me problems with email form not asking to follow usual email pattern while using usual id="email", but I managed to fix it with id="exampleInputEmail1" snippet that solved the problem.
Also initially I had phone number in the form, but I removed it due to the fact that people wouldn't be very happy to share their phone numbers.
<br>
I am not perfectly happy with the font size in different ratios, but with the knowledge and skills I have acquired so far, this is the best verison I can come up with.

<h3>Work based on other code</h3>
I used Code Institute instructional video of Resume Project in the beginning stages of setting up the backbone of the code and started modifying the content from there.
I also used some guidance from Online Tutorials youtube page to add hover effects to menu, social links and create the Book Us form.

<h3>What changed after user design experience (UDX) phase</h3>
The initial idea of having the online shop on home page, changed into having the text introducing the shop on the homepage and the actual link in the footer.
