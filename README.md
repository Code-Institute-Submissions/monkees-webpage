<h1>User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - Monkees Webpage</h1>
<h3>What does it do and what need does it fulfil?</h3>
The project is created by using skills I have acquired during the first few months of studying coding to create a mobile-first fully responsive static website for the band The Monkees. The purpose of the website is to allow the fans of The Monkees to listen to their music, watch a video, check out the latest news and concert dates, join other fans on social media and contact the bandâ€™s manager to possibly hire the band to perform at an event.
<h3>Functionality of the project</h3>
The website is fully responsive. The picture of the band is visible on larger screens and hidden on smaller ones. The navigation on website is functional and the Book Us form is input validated. The submitting of the form does not connect to  anything at the moment, but as the scope of the project was only front-end, I did not find it useful to spend my time working on that part.
<h3>Technologies used to create the project</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cloud IDE
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>FontAwesome</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>GIT</li>
<li>GITHUB</li>
<li>Google Chrome developer tools</li></ul>
 
 
<h3>Deployment</h3>
Website was coded in Cloud 9 IDE, a local GIT directory was used for version control and then uploaded to GITHUB using Ubuntu / Bash script. Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at:https://kaidoso.github.io/monkees-webpage/
<h3>Testing</h3>
Each page was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, testing its functionality as well as look and feel (in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, Nexus 5S, Nexus 6P, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. All links were tested along with music tracks audio controls and video player. The modal join fan club form and the hire us form was tested locally and remotely.
<h3>Work based on other code</h3>
I used Code Institute instructional video of Resume Project in the beginning stages of setting up the backbone of the code and started modifying the content from there.
I also used some guidance from Online Tutorials youtube page to add hover effects to menu, social links and create the Book Us form.
<h3>What changed after user design experience (UDX) phase</h3>
The initial idea of having the online shop on home page, changed into having the text introducing the shop on the homepage and the actual link in the footer.
